## About

This repository is a collection of my personal notes and solutions to the problem sets assigned in CS50x 2024. Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or problem set and contains the relevant files along with any necessary resources or additional documentation.

Please note that while this repository provides solutions, it is essential to understand the code and concepts behind each solution. Copying solutions without understanding the underlying principles may hinder your learning experience.

## Personal Notes
